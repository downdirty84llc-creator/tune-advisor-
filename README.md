# Georgia Opportunity Ledger

A subscription intelligence platform for commercial property, business funding
and market pricing in Georgia. Public and authorised sources are monitored,
verified, scored against a published 100-point method, and distributed to
subscribers through a searchable database, a weekly report, immediate alerts and
a deadline calendar.

**Not** a brokerage, an MLS, a lender, an investment adviser, a legal service or
an appraisal service. Nothing it publishes guarantees eligibility, financing or
performance — that constraint is written into the product, not just the footer.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local          # fill in Supabase and Stripe values

supabase start                      # local Postgres + Auth + Storage
supabase db reset                   # runs migrations, then supabase/seed.sql
npm run db:seed                     # demo users, sample records, sample reports

npm run dev                         # http://localhost:3000
```

Seeded accounts (password from `SEED_PASSWORD`, default
`ledger-demo-password-2026`):

| Email                         | Role                   | Plan     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| `free.member@example.com`     | member                 | Free     |
| `weekly.member@example.com`   | member                 | Weekly   |
| `detailed.member@example.com` | member                 | Detailed |
| `premium.member@example.com`  | member                 | Premium  |
| `researcher@example.com`      | researcher             | —        |
| `reviewer@example.com`        | reviewer               | —        |
| `editor@example.com`          | editor                 | —        |
| `support@example.com`         | support representative | —        |
| `billing@example.com`         | billing manager        | —        |
| `admin@example.com`           | super administrator    | —        |

Everything the seeder writes carries `is_sample = true` on the profile,
opportunity, indicator-value and report rows, is badged wherever it appears, and
is carried through into CSV exports so a spreadsheet cannot quietly launder demo
data into a real decision. The seeder refuses to run when
`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production`.

## Commands

| Command             | What it does                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Development server                                  |
| `npm run build`     | Production build                                    |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`                                      |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint                                              |
| `npm test`          | Unit and integration tests (Vitest)                 |
| `npm run test:e2e`  | End-to-end tests (Playwright)                       |
| `npm run db:reset`  | Re-runs every migration and the reference-data seed |
| `npm run db:seed`   | Loads demo users and sample records                 |
| `npm run db:types`  | Regenerates database types from a live schema       |
| `npm run format`    | Prettier over `ts,tsx,md,json,sql`                  |

`npm run test:e2e` builds the app and starts it itself; point `E2E_BASE_URL` at
a running instance to skip that and test the deployment instead. `npm test`
needs no database, which is the reason database-dependent tests are kept out of
`tests/unit/`.

## How access control works

This is the part to understand before changing anything.

A **rank** is a single integer answering "how much of a record may this account
read": Free 0, Weekly 10, Detailed 20, Premium 30, staff 100. Ranks are compared
with `>=` against an opportunity's `minimum_access_rank`, and they are spaced ten
apart so a tier can be inserted later without renumbering published content.

The rule is enforced in **three independent places**, deliberately:

1. **Row-level security** on every table. A leaked anon key gets nothing it
   should not have, whatever the application does.
2. **`public.search_opportunities`**, a `SECURITY DEFINER` function that applies
   column-level redaction — RLS is row-level and cannot express "this member may
   see the title but not the financials", which is exactly what the upsell
   requires.
3. **`src/lib/access`** in TypeScript, so the API can return a useful 402 with
   the plan that would unlock the record rather than an opaque empty result.

The TypeScript and SQL halves are kept in step by
`tests/unit/access/plan-parity.test.ts`, which reads `supabase/seed.sql`
directly and diffs every `feature_configuration` document against the compiled
`PLAN_FEATURE_DEFAULTS`. It is the only test that crosses that boundary; change
a limit in one place without the other and it fails.
`tests/unit/access/subscription.test.ts` covers a different question — how
account status, role, Stripe status and an administrative override resolve into
one rank — and never reads SQL.

Administrator permissions are decided by **role**, never by plan. A Premium
member has rank 30 and no administrative access whatsoever.

There is no integration suite. `npm test` is unit-only by design — no database,
no network, no fixtures — which is what lets it run on every save and never fail
for an environmental reason. The Vitest config used to glob a `tests/integration/`
directory that has never existed; a pattern matching nothing reads as coverage
that is present, so it was removed rather than filled. Filling it needs a live
Postgres and therefore a decision about how CI gets one, and that decision has
not been made. Until it is, database-backed behaviour is covered by
`npm run test:e2e` against a built app.

---

## Environments

Development, staging and production each use their **own** database
credentials, auth credentials, Stripe keys, email keys, storage buckets, API
secrets and analytics project. Production data is never copied into development
without sanitisation.

Staging and production are separated by more than configuration: `robots.ts`
blocks indexing outside production, the seeder refuses to run in production, and
a banner marks every non-production page.

---

## Deployment

- **Application** — Vercel. `vercel.json` declares the cron schedule for all
  thirteen background jobs.
- **Database, auth and storage** — Supabase Postgres.
- **Payments** — Stripe. Checkout, the customer portal and every card detail
  live in Stripe; this application never receives a card number.
- **Email** — Resend or Postmark behind `src/lib/email/client.ts`. Locally the
  `console` provider prints instead of sending, so a test run cannot email real
  people.

Background jobs authenticate with `CRON_SECRET`, compared in constant time.
Every run writes a `job_runs` row visible on the admin dashboard, and jobs that
must run once per window claim an idempotency key so a double-fire cannot send a
second round of emails.

See `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for the launch checklist and operational procedures.

---

## Testing

`npm test` runs 148 unit tests covering the parts where a quiet mistake costs
money or leaks paid content: score arithmetic and classification bands,
subscription-status resolution including the past-due grace window, entitlement
decisions per tier, alert matching and suppression keys, deadline lifecycle
transitions, CSV escaping and formula-injection defence, filter parsing, and
unsubscribe token signing and tampering.

`npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright against a built app across desktop, iPhone,
Android and tablet viewports.

---

## Administrator two-factor

Every staff role must enrol a TOTP factor before the admin area opens, and must
have presented it in the current session. Enrolment lives at `/admin/security`,
which is exempt from its own gate. The check fails open on an unexpected error —
a Supabase outage should not be indistinguishable from a missing second factor,
and row-level security still enforces every permission underneath.

---

## Status

Milestones 2 through 9 of the specification are implemented; see
`docs/MILESTONES.md` for the per-milestone breakdown and the six things that
remain. Two are hard launch blockers: legal review of the ten documents in
`src/lib/legal/documents.ts`, and creating the Stripe products and prices so the
tier-by-tier payment matrix can be run.
