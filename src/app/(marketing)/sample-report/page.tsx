        This is the structure every weekly report follows. One record is shown

        members below the required tier would see them.

          <p>
            The week&rsquo;s ledger is weighted toward deadline pressure rather
            than new inventory: several programs close inside the next fortnight
            and two property registrations close sooner than their sale dates
            suggest. Where a deadline and a sale date differ, the deadline is
            the one that binds.
          </p>
          <p>
            On pricing, the picture is mixed. Input costs remain the constraint
            on new construction, while lending conditions have moved enough that
            deals underwritten earlier in the year should be re-run before they
            are committed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you read one thing this week, read the record below. It is the
            highest-scoring item in the ledger, and the reason is set out
            component by component rather than asserted.
