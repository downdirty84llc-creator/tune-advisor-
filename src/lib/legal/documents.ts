/**
 * Legal and policy documents (spec 25).
 *
 * These are drafted to describe how the product actually behaves — the access
 * rules, the billing behaviour, the retention posture — so that a lawyer is
 * reviewing an accurate description rather than writing from scratch. The
 * launch checklist blocks production on that review being signed off.
 *
 * Seven of the ten carry `requiresReview: true` and render the banner. The
 * three that do not — editorial standards, corrections, data sources — describe
 * our own practice rather than binding the member to anything, so nothing turns
 * on counsel's wording. That exemption has not been confirmed by counsel; the
 * runbook carries it as an open decision rather than a settled one.
