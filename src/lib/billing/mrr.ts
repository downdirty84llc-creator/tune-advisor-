/**
 * Monthly recurring revenue.
 *
 * This existed inline on the admin dashboard and was wrong: it summed
 * `monthly_price` for every active subscription regardless of billing interval,
 * under a comment claiming it normalised annual plans to a monthly figure. An
 * annual Premium subscriber was counted at $99 rather than the $82.50 they
 * actually contribute each month — an overstatement of about 17% per annual
 * subscriber, on a number used for planning.
 *
 * Three decisions are recorded here rather than left implicit in a format
 * string, because each has a defensible alternative.
 *
 * **Integer arithmetic, in annualised cents.** Prices are `numeric(10, 2)`, so
 * cents are exact; dividing dollars by twelve in floating point is not. Each
 * subscription is converted to the cents it contributes over a year — a monthly
 * plan multiplied by twelve, an annual plan taken as-is — the integers are
 * summed, and the division by twelve happens **once**, at the end.
 *
 * The alternative was to divide each subscription to a monthly figure and round
 * per row. Rejected: that rounds N times instead of once, so a thousand
 * subscribers on a plan that does not divide evenly can drift by a couple of
 * dollars from the true total for no benefit. Annualised cents avoids the
 * choice entirely — nothing is rounded until the single final division, and
 * every intermediate value is an exact integer.
 *
 * **An unrecognised billing interval counts as monthly.** `billing_interval` is
 * `not null default 'monthly'` with only two enum values, so a missing or
 * unknown one means something upstream is already broken — a bad sync, a
 * hand-edited row, a migration in flight. Given that, monthly is the column's
 * own answer for "unspecified", and it is the safer of two bad options:
 * contributing zero would assert that a subscriber with an active subscription
 * pays nothing, which hides a real customer, whereas the monthly reading is at
 * most an overstatement of the same customer by the difference between the two
 * rates. Neither is silent — `unresolvedIntervals` reports how many rows took
 * the fallback, so "the number looks high" has an answer.
 *
 * **Cents, not dollars, are returned.** The dashboard renders through
 * `formatMoney`, which is configured to whole dollars, but that is a display
 * decision and this is the underlying figure. Returning pre-rounded dollars
 * would bake the dashboard's formatting into anything that later reads MRR for
 * an export or an API.
