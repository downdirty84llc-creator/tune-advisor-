## The finding that governs everything else

**This business had a working revenue model, stopped using it, and replaced it
with one that has never produced a sale.**

The sequence is unambiguous:

- **Feb–Sep 2025** — $3,507.86 collected through **invoiced service work**.
  Relationship-based, high-ticket (average $350.79, largest $1,287.50), and
  genuinely repeat: customer A paid six separate invoices over five months.
- **Sep 2025** — invoicing stops. No revenue since.
- **Jan 2026** — a large self-serve Shopify catalogue launches, four months
  _after_ the money stopped.
- **Jan 2026 – today** — 574 sessions, 20 checkout attempts, **$0**.

The catalogue is not the problem in the way it first appears. The problem is
that the motion which demonstrably made money — invoice a named customer for
work — was abandoned, and the motion that replaced it has no audience pointed
at it. Seven search visits in six months is not a conversion problem. It is
invisibility.

### A correction to my own earlier diagnosis

I first reported the 0-of-20 checkout record as a near-certain fault, calling it
"roughly a one-in-a-million result". **That was bad statistics and I withdraw
it.** It assumed twenty independent buyers with genuine intent. Spread across
twelve months that is 1.7 checkout-reaches per month, most of them inside the
January launch spike when the store was being built and very likely tested by
the owner. At that volume zero completions is unremarkable. Four mechanical
causes were then checked and all four are configured correctly (T10).

Checkout is **not cleared** — it is merely **not indicted**. One real test
purchase settles it, and that is listed below as hygiene rather than as an
opportunity.

**Priority rule.** T-01 leads despite tying on score, because §9 puts urgent
revenue recovery ahead of everything. It is also the only item that could
produce cash this week. T-07 is scored low but **blocks T-02**, and it is nearly
free, so it runs first in practice.

### Hygiene, not an opportunity

**One test purchase.** Buy something from the store on a real card, then refund
it. It costs a few dollars in fees and definitively separates "checkout is fine,
nobody visits" from "checkout is broken." Not scored, because clearing a doubt
is not a revenue opportunity — but do it before spending anything on traffic.

| **Revenue potential**       | None directly. It is what makes the other briefs specific instead of generic.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Risks and safeguards**    | None material. Customer data stays out of version control.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### T-02 — Resume the invoiced service motion · 70

| Field                       | Content                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opportunity**             | 100% of revenue this business has ever earned came from invoiced service work. 0% came from the self-serve catalogue, across 574 sessions. The evidence for which model works is one-sided.   |
| **Business fit**            | The core tuning and diagnostic services.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Target customer**         | The same profile that already paid: owners and shops wanting hands-on calibration and diagnostic work, who expect a quote and an invoice rather than an add-to-cart.                          |
| **Offer**                   | Named services at the prices already proven ($175–$1,287 observed), quoted per job.                                                                                                           |
| **Execution**               | Re-establish intake → quote → invoice as the primary path, with the catalogue supporting it rather than replacing it. Requires T-07 to know which services to lead with.                      |
| **Channels**                | Direct, referral, and whatever channel produced the original three customers — **currently unknown**, which is itself worth establishing.                                                     |
| **Cost and budget ceiling** | **$0** for the motion itself. Any paid acquisition is a separate brief.                                                                                                                       |
| **Revenue potential**       | Historic monthly run rate Feb–Sep 2025 was roughly $438/month across three customers. **That is history, not a projection**, and it came from a customer base too small to extrapolate.       |
| **Risks and safeguards**    | Invoiced work does not scale without owner time, which is exactly why the catalogue was built; this brief argues for sequencing, not for abandoning the catalogue. Do not guarantee outcomes. |
| **Success metrics**         | Quotes issued per month, quote-to-invoice rate, collected revenue, repeat rate.                                                                                                               |
| **Approval choices**        | Approve as planned · approve with changes · hold · reject                                                                                                                                     |
| **After approval**          | Rev builds the intake-to-invoice path and the follow-up rules, after T-07 answers what to lead with.                                                                                          |

### Remaining queue — summaries

- **T-04 · Make the catalogue findable (63).** Seven search visits in 180 days.
  The catalogue is well written and completely invisible. This is the long-term
  fix and contributes nothing this quarter, which is why it sits behind the
  reactivation work.
- **T-06 · Referrals from the repeat customers (58).** Customer A bought six
  times. People who buy six times know other people with the same problem. Ask
  only after T-01 has re-established contact.
- **T-05 · Consolidate the three surfaces (57).** dd84tuning.com, the Shopify
  store and the Stripe/bookipay invoicing are three disconnected places.
  Traffic landing on one cannot buy on another, and revenue is tracked in two
  systems that do not talk.

## Open questions Rev could not answer

1. **What were the ten invoices for?** No line items in Stripe (T-07).
2. **Where did the three customers come from?** No attribution exists for
   invoiced work.
3. **Are the eight missing invoice numbers unpaid?** #1–4, #11, #12, #15 and #16
   have no successful charge. They may be drafts, voided, or paid another way —
   **or they may be unpaid invoices, which would be the fastest cash in this
   document.** Requires bookipay access to check.
4. **What is on dd84tuning.com?** It returns 403 to automated fetches.

## What Rev is asking for

Run **T-07** first — it is free and it makes everything else specific. Then
**T-01**, which is the only item that can produce revenue this week. Then decide
between **T-02** and **T-04** depending on whether the goal is cash now or
compounding traffic later.

And do the test purchase before spending a dollar on traffic.

## Completion record — T-04, catalogue SEO · 2026-08-03

Approved and executed against the live Shopify store. **Metadata only** — no
product handle, visible title, price, description or publication status was
changed, so no existing URL breaks and nothing customers see moved.

### What was changed

**Five tuning-service products** had no SEO title at all. These are the ones
that matter, because they are the same invoiced service work that produced
100% of this venture's revenue:

| Product                                    | New SEO title                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Holley EFI Tuning & Diagnostics Service    | Holley EFI Tuning & Diagnostics Service \| DD84    |
| Toyota / Lexus Performance Tuning Service  | Toyota & Lexus Performance ECU Tuning \| DD84      |
| Dodge / Mopar Custom ECU Tuning Service    | Dodge & Mopar Custom ECU Tuning Service \| DD84    |
| Dodge / Mopar PCM Unlock Service           | Dodge & Mopar PCM Unlock Service \| DD84           |
| Performance Wiring & EFI Power Diagnostics | Performance Wiring & EFI Power Diagnostics \| DD84 |

Each also received a meta description under 160 characters.

**Three collections** had no SEO. Collection pages usually rank for category
terms, so these were the highest-leverage gap in the catalogue:

- Holley EFI Custom Calibration Services (6 products)
- Digital Downloads (27) → "Digital Tuning Downloads, Guides & Calibrations"
- DD84 Performance Merch (17) → "Automotive Performance Apparel & Garage Merch"

**Ten merch products** had descriptions but no SEO title. Filled in.

Result: **48 of 50 active products** and **4 of 6 collections** now carry an
SEO title, up from 31 and 1.

### The pattern used, and why

Existing good entries already followed "search term first, brand last"
(`Holley EFI LS Naturally Aspirated Startup File | DD84`). That house style was
matched exactly rather than replaced.

It matters more than it looks. Twenty-nine of the fifty product titles begin
with "DD84" or "Down Dirty 84", which puts the highest-weight position in the
title tag on a brand that drew **seven search visits in 180 days**. Leading with
the term a stranger would actually type — "Holley EFI tuning", "Dodge PCM
unlock" — and keeping the brand as the suffix costs nothing and stops wasting
that position. The visible product titles were left alone; only the `<title>`
tag changed.

### Deliberately not done

- **The duplicate pair.** "DD84 Tune Support Advisor Access" exists **twice**,
  both active, both $99, both with no SEO. Giving two identical pages SEO titles
  would create competing duplicate pages, which is worse than leaving them
  blank. One should be archived or merged — that is a destructive change and
  needs an owner decision.
- **"General Clothes example products"** — an empty leftover from the theme
  demo, still live with 0 products. Should be deleted; not Rev's call.
- **"Home page"** — the theme's default collection, left alone.
- **Handles and visible titles** — unchanged on purpose. Changing a handle
  404s every existing link to that product.

### Honest expectation

This will not produce revenue quickly, and it is not a substitute for the
briefs above. Search takes weeks to months to reflect metadata changes, the
baseline is seven visits per 180 days, and metadata alone does not create
authority for competitive terms like "Holley EFI tuning".

What it does is remove a self-inflicted handicap and make the catalogue
eligible to be found. **T-01 — reactivating the three customers who already
paid — remains the only item in this register that could produce cash this
week.**
