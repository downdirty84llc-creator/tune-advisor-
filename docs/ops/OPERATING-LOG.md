# DD84 operating log

Append-only execution record, in the fields required by
`docs/DD84-OPERATIONS-AGENT.md` §9: timestamp, action, tool, source, operator,
before/after state, evidence, error and remediation.

**Rules.**

- **Append only.** No entry is ever edited or deleted, including one that records
  a mistake. A wrong entry is corrected by a later entry that references it —
  the same discipline the `audit_logs` table enforces in the product, where
  there is deliberately no update or delete policy for anyone.
- One entry per action that changed something, plus one per routine run — a run
  that found nothing still gets an entry. Silence in this file must mean "did not
  run", never "ran and found nothing".
- Evidence is a commit hash, a confirmation number, a URL, a query result or
  real command output. "Completed successfully" is not evidence.
- Timestamps are UTC.
- Entry IDs are sequential: `OL-nnnn`.

**Seeded 2026-08-06.** Entries OL-0001 to OL-0006 are reconstructed from
`git log` on `claude/claude-md-docs-jjveuq`; their timestamps are the real commit
timestamps and the evidence is verifiable with `git show`. The owner's brief
described five landed commits; the branch carries six since the platform build.
The sixth, `3d22acc`, was a small follow-up correcting the documentation written
in `8337e41`. It is logged as it is rather than as it was described.

## OL-0001 — Adopt the DD84 specification into the repository

- **Timestamp** 2026-07-31T10:55:18Z
- **Task** T-01, T-02, T-03 · **Approval** A-01
- **Action** Added `docs/DD84-OPERATIONS-AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and
  `.claude/agents/torque.md`.
- **Tool** Local file write; `git commit`
- **Source** Owner-supplied PDF specification, July 2026
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** No governance documents in the repository; no agent definition.
- **After** Three files, 1,106 lines added.
- **Evidence** Commit `6468118`
- **Error** None
- **Remediation** n/a

## OL-0002 — Correct documentation that had drifted away from the code

- **Timestamp** 2026-07-31T11:17:45Z
- **Task** T-04, T-05 · **Approval** A-02
- **Action** Corrected README, ARCHITECTURE, MILESTONES and RUNBOOK; set the
  `requiresReview` flags truthfully in `src/lib/legal/documents.ts`.
- **Tool** Local file edit; `git commit`
- **Source** Agent review of documented claims against the implementation
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** Documentation asserted behaviour the code did not have; legal
  documents did not declare their review state.
- **After** Five files, +122/−57. Seven legal documents now render the "awaiting
  legal review" banner.
- **Evidence** Commit `a489144`
- **Error** None
- **Remediation** The exemption claimed for three legal documents was recorded as
  an open question rather than resolved. Follow-up task T-13, packet A-06.

## OL-0003 — Exclude demo accounts from subscriber, revenue and analytics counts

- **Timestamp** 2026-07-31T17:00:01Z
- **Task** T-06, T-12 · **Approval** A-03
- **Action** Added `src/lib/analytics/sample-data.ts`; applied the exclusion to
  the admin dashboard subscriber and revenue tiles and to the
  `aggregate-analytics` job; documented the rule in CLAUDE.md.
- **Tool** Local file edit; Vitest; `git commit`
- **Source** Agent finding: `scripts/seed.ts` writes ten `is_sample` accounts
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** Seeded demo accounts counted toward the subscriber total, MRR and
  the analytics aggregate.
- **After** Six files, +274/−27, including 13 new unit tests.
- **Evidence** Commit `1039582`; `tests/unit/analytics/sample-data.test.ts`
- **Error** None
- **Remediation** n/a. **The rendered dashboard numbers were not observed** —
  nothing here has run against a database. T-06 remains In Verification.

## OL-0004 — Normalise annual subscriptions in the MRR calculation

- **Timestamp** 2026-07-31T17:22:11Z
- **Task** T-07 · **Approval** A-04
- **Action** Extracted MRR arithmetic into `src/lib/billing/mrr.ts`; annual
  subscribers now count at a twelfth of the annual price.
- **Tool** Local file edit; Vitest; `git commit`
- **Source** Agent review of the admin revenue tile against plan intervals
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** An annual subscriber was counted at the monthly price, overstating
  MRR.
- **After** Four files, +393/−15, including 18 unit tests.
- **Evidence** Commit `5ae44fa`; `tests/unit/billing/mrr.test.ts`
- **Error** None
- **Remediation** n/a

## OL-0005 — Security review of the API surface, and two fixes found by it

- **Timestamp** 2026-08-02T18:48:02Z
- **Task** T-09, T-08, T-06 · **Approval** S-01 (T-08, T-09), A-03 (T-06)
- **Action** Three things. (1) Replaced an interpolated PostgREST `.or()` filter
  in the opportunity detail fallback with a bound column match, exporting
  `isOpportunityId` so both lookups discriminate identically. (2) Extended the
  sample-account exclusion to the failed-payment tile. (3) Dropped the
  `tests/integration/**` glob from the Vitest include.
- **Tool** Local file edit; Vitest; `git commit`
- **Source** Agent security review of the API surface
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** A crafted path segment was parsed as filter structure rather than as
  a value; the failed-payment tile counted sample accounts; the test config
  declared a directory that has never existed.
- **After** Seven files, +97/−14, three new tests pinning the rendered filter
  shape.
- **Evidence** Commit `8337e41`. The commit message also records which parts of
  the surface were reviewed and found correct — webhook signature verification,
  constant-time job auth, unsubscribe token length-checking, the error handler's
  opaque body, constant-message password reset, the PATCH column allowlist, the
  export rank cap and the audit-log grant chain — so they are not re-reviewed.
- **Error** None during execution.
- **Remediation** Risk of the injection was assessed and recorded as
  malformed-query rather than disclosure: the target view is already granted to
  anon, already restricted to published non-restricted rows, and carries no paid
  field. Fixed because the pattern gets copied, not because the blast radius was
  large.

## OL-0006 — Correct the test counts and integration-suite claim in CLAUDE.md

- **Timestamp** 2026-08-05T09:28:00Z
- **Task** T-10 · **Approval** S-01
- **Action** Ran the suite and wrote the real figures into CLAUDE.md; removed the
  claim of an integration suite.
- **Tool** `npm test`; local file edit; `git commit`
- **Source** Agent verification of CLAUDE.md against a real run
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** CLAUDE.md stated counts that no longer matched, and implied
  integration coverage that does not exist.
- **After** CLAUDE.md states 179 tests in 11 files.
- **Evidence** Commit `3d22acc`
- **Error** None
- **Remediation** n/a

## OL-0007 — Build the operations control plane

- **Timestamp** 2026-08-06T19:18:00Z
- **Task** T-18, T-19, T-20, T-21 · **Approval** A-08
- **Action** Created six routine commands in `.claude/commands/`
  (`dd84-daily-brief`, `dd84-inbox-intake`, `dd84-followup`, `dd84-cash-review`,
  `dd84-opportunity-scan`, `dd84-site-monitor`); created `docs/ops/` with
  `README.md`, `TASK-REGISTER.md`, `APPROVALS.md`, `OPERATING-LOG.md` and
  `briefs/`; extended `.claude/agents/torque.md` with the §4 task fields, the
  §10 prioritisation factors and the §14 escalation table; added one additive
  subsection to CLAUDE.md §10.
- **Tool** Local file write; `npm run format`; `npm run typecheck`;
  `npm run lint`; `npm test`
- **Source** Owner instruction, 2026-08-06
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** The agent had an identity but no runnable routines and no durable
  operating state; task and approval state lived in conversation transcripts.
- **After** Six commands and a four-file operating record on disk. **No
  connector was contacted and no live system was read or written** — this was
  entirely a repository change.
- **Evidence** The files themselves; verification output recorded in the next
  entry, **after** the commands were actually run. The register was seeded
  from `git log`, `docs/MILESTONES.md` and the owner's stated statuses; fields
  that could not be sourced from an artifact read `not recorded`.
- **Error** None
- **Remediation** T-19 is held at **In Verification**, not Done: Torque cannot
  confirm from inside the repository that the seeded register is complete. Work
  that was discussed but never touched a file leaves no trace here. Owner
  confirmation closes it.

## OL-0008 — Verify the operations control plane

- **Timestamp** 2026-08-06T19:24:49Z
- **Task** T-22 · **Approval** A-08
- **Action** Ran the verification chain over the change from OL-0007.
- **Tool** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`,
  `npx prettier --check`
- **Source** T-22
- **Operator** Torque (agent)
- **Before** Suite green at `3d22acc`: 179 tests in 11 files.
- **After** Unchanged, as a markdown-only change should leave it.
- **Evidence** — real output:
  - `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`, exit 0, no diagnostics.
  - `npm run lint` — `✔ No ESLint warnings or errors`. (Also emits a Next.js
    notice that `next lint` is deprecated and removed in Next.js 16 — pre-existing,
    unrelated to this change, and not acted on here.)
  - `npm test` — `Test Files 11 passed (11)`, `Tests 179 passed (179)`,
    duration 1.67s.
  - `npx prettier --check` over the eleven added and modified markdown files —
    `All matched files use Prettier code style!`
- **Error** None from this change.
- **Remediation** `npm run format:check` across the whole repository fails on
  **105 pre-existing files** — the `src/` tree, the unit tests, `scripts/seed.ts`
  and `vercel.json`. Confirmed pre-existing by stashing this change and
  re-running the check against clean `3d22acc`, where `src/lib/scoring/score.ts`
  still fails. **Not fixed here** — reformatting 105 unrelated files while
  landing this change is silent scope expansion. Raised as **T-26**.
